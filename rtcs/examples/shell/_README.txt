				RTCS Shell Application


1. Introduction.
----------------
This is the main RTCS example that is used to demonstrate different features of the RTCS TCP/IP stack. The example allows performing initialization and configuration of network interfaces, running RTCS application services like DHCP, DNS, FTP, TFTP, Telnet, SMTP and others.


2. Running the application.
---------------------------
1) Prepare your evaluation board according to the "MQX Getting started" document.
   Pay special attention for correct jumper settings.
2) Connect the serial cable to your PC and to the evaluation board.
3) Connect the evaluation board and your PC to an Ethernet network.
4) Start Terminal application on your PC. 
   Set serial port settings to 115200 baud rate, no parity and 8 bits.
5) Compile all required libraries (BSP, PSP, MFS, RTCS).
   To use WIFI on shell example, please follow steps below:
     1. By default, WIFI is disabled. To use WIFI, BSPCFG_ENABLE_<vendor>_WIFI definition must be enabled in user_config.h
     2. Update WIFI configuration in config.h header file if necessary.
6) Compile, load and run the application. In terminal window:  
		Initialized Ram Disk to a:\

		Free disk space: 6 kB or 6144 bytes.

		Shell (build: Feb 10 2015)

		shell>
		shell>
7) The RTCS Shell is now able to accept user commands.
8) Enter "help" command to display full command list and its syntax.

3. Using application.
---------------------
This chapter describes typical actions that can be done in the RTCS Shell application. 
To get information about all available shell commands enter the "help" command.

3.1) Initialize Ethernet Interface.
-----------------------------------
At application startup, no interface is initialized.
Its initialization should be done using the "ipconfig [device] init" command. For example:
	shell> ipconfig 0 init
	Ethernet device 0 initialization successful.
NOTE: 
	If [device] is not entered, assumed device number is zero.

3.2) Release Ethernet Interface.
--------------------------------
Use the "ipconfig [device] release" command. For example:
	shell> ipconfig 0 release
	Ethernet device 0 release successful.

3.3) Change Ethernet Interface parameters.
------------------------------------------
3.3.1) Bind IPv4 address manually.
---------------------------------- 
Use the "ipconfig [device] ip <ipv4> <mask> [<gateway>]" command. For example:
	shell> ipconfig 0 ip 192.168.0.22 255.255.255.0
	Static IP4 bind successful.
	
3.3.2) Bind address parameters using DHCPv4.
-------------------------------------------- 
Use the "ipconfig [device] dhcp" command. For example:
	shell> ipconfig 0 dhcp
	Bind via dhcp successful.
	
3.3.3) Bind IPv6 address manually.
---------------------------------- 
Binding IPv6 address is done automatically during stateless address autoconfiguration, so the manual binding of IPv6 address is optional.
If it is really needed, it can be done using the "ipconfig [device] ip <ipv6>" command. For example:
	shell> ipconfig 0 ip 0123:4567:89ab:cdef:0123:4567:89ab:cdef
	IP6 bind successful.

3.3.4) Get interface parameters from DHCPv6
-------------------------------------------
Use the "ipconfig [device] dhcp6" command. For example:
	shell> ipconfig dhcp6
	DHCPv6 initialization successful.
	Address from DHCPv6 server obtained.

3.3.5) Unbind IPv6 address. 
---------------------------
Use the "ipconfig [device] unbind <ipv6>" command. For example:
	shell> ipconfig 0 unbind 0123:4567:89ab:cdef:0123:4567:89ab:cdef
	Unbind successful.

3.4) Add gateway.
-----------------
To add a gateway to the routing table, use the "gate <gateway> [<netaddr>] [<netmask>]" command. For example:
	shell> gate 192.168.0.5
	Adding gateway 192.168.0.5, ip address: 0.0.0.0, netmask: 0.0.0.0

3.5) View Ethernet Interface parameters.
----------------------------------------
Use the "ipconfig [device]" command:
	shell> ipconfig
	Eth#     : 0
	Link     : on
	MAC      : 00:00:5e:00:00:00
	IP4      : 192.168.22.193 Type: DHCPNOAUTO
	IP4 Mask : 255.255.255.0
	IP4 Gate : 192.168.22.1
	IP4 DNS  : 212.71.186.249
	IP6      : fe80::200:5eff:fe00:0 State: PREFERRED Type: AUTOCONFIGURABLE
	ScopeID  : 2
	Link status task stopped

	NOTE: For information about Link status task refer to RTCS User's Guide.

3.6) DNS address resolver.
--------------------------
3.6.1) Add DNS Server address manually.
---------------------------------------
Usually, the DNS server address list is updated automatically by DHCP client or Router Discovery mechanism. 
If needed, it is possible to add DNS Server address manually, using the "ipconfig [device] dns add <ip>" command. For example:
	shell> ipconfig 0 dns add 192.168.0.5
	Add dns ip successful.
	
3.6.2) Delete DNS Server address manually.
------------------------------------------
If needed, it is possible to delete DNS Server address manually, using the "ipconfig [device] dns del <ip>" command. For example:
	shell> ipconfig 0 dns del 192.168.0.5
	Del dns ip successful.

3.6.3) Display DNS Server address list.
---------------------------------------
To print all DNS Server addresses, assigned to an interface, use "ipconfig [device] dns". For example:
	shell> ipconfig 0 dns
	[1] 212.71.186.249

3.6.4) Resolve host name.
-------------------------
Use the "gethbn <host>" command. For example:
	shell> gethbn www.example.com
	www.example.com 93.184.216.119
	www.example.com 2606:2800:220:6d:26bf:1447:1097:aa7

3.7) Ping.
----------
Use the "ping [-c count] [-h hoplimit] [-i interval] [-p pattern] [-s size] <host>" command. For example:
	shell> ping www.example.com
	Pinging 93.184.216.119:
	Press [q] to cancel.
	Reply from [93.184.216.119]: time=138ms
	Reply from [93.184.216.119]: time=130ms
	Reply from [93.184.216.119]: time=132ms
	Reply from [93.184.216.119]: time=132ms

3.8) Display network statistic.
-------------------------------
Use the "netstat" command. For example:
	shell> netstat

	ENET (1fff9bc0):
	   113 packets received
	   9 packets transmitted

	IPv4:
	   10 packets received
	   7 packets delivered
	   3 discarded for other reasons:
	   3   with an illegal destination

	IPv6:
	   4 packets sent

	ICMPv4:
	   0 packets sent or received

	ICMPv6:
	   4 Unknown

	UDP:
	   7 packets received
	   7 discarded for other reasons:
	   7   with unknown ports

	TCP:
	   0 packets sent or received

renewing of bound IPv4 address, statically or via DHCP, 
to be sure that the bind-address does not conflict with new network.

3.17.1 Start Link Status task.
------------------------------ 
The Link-Staus task is stopped by default. 
Use the "ipcfg task start <period in ms>" command to start it. For example:

3.18.1 Start ECHO client.
-------------------------
Use the "echo <server> [-p protocol] [-d data_pattern] [-n pattern_repeat] [-f family] [-s service] [-c count]" command. For example:
  shell> echo localhost
  shell> echo localhost -p udp -d hello -n 200 -f 6 -s 7 -c 100000
  shell> echo ::1 -p udp -d hello -n 200 -c 100000
  shell> echo www.example.com -d hello -f 4 -s 7 -c 100000

  NOTE: RTCSCFG_ENABLE_LOOPBACK shall be enabled to allow RTCS for local tcp/udp socket echo.

3.19 LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution) Server. RFC4795.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
3.19.1 Start LLMNR Server.
-------------------------
Use the "llmnr [<device>] [-h <host name>[;<host name>...]] start" command. For example:
    shell> llmnr -h hostname start
    LLMNR Server Started. Host Name = hostname
After that, it is possible to reach the node, on same local network, using "hostname" instead of its IP addresses.
For example, ping the node: 
    C:\>ping hostname
    Pinging hostname [fe80::200:5eff:fe00:0%16] with 32 bytes of data:
    Reply from fe80::200:5eff:fe00:0%16: time<1ms
    Reply from fe80::200:5eff:fe00:0%16: time<1ms
    Reply from fe80::200:5eff:fe00:0%16: time<1ms
    Reply from fe80::200:5eff:fe00:0%16: time<1ms

    Ping statistics for fe80::200:5eff:fe00:0%16:
        Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
    Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
       Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 0ms, Average = 0ms
NOTE: 
    If <device> is not entered, assumed the device number is zero.
    If <host name> is not entered, assumed the host name is "rtcs".
KNOWN ISSUES:
   In case you tried to reach the node, before LLMNR server start, no LLMNR response is sent, 
   a Windows resolver treats it as the host name does not exist and does not send 
   any new LLMNR requests during big time out.
   SOLUTION:  Purges the DNS Resolver cache, using the following command:
              C:\>ipconfig /flushdns
              Windows IP Configuration
              Successfully flushed the DNS Resolver Cache.
3.19.2 Stop LLMNR server.
------------------------
Use the "llmnr [device] stop" command. For example:
    shell> llmnr stop
    LLMNR Server Stopped.
